# Algorithm Visualizer

This project is an interactive web-based tool designed to visualize various sorting and searching algorithms. It provides a clear, intuitive, and educational experience for understanding how these algorithms work.

## Features

* **Algorithm Visualization:**
    * Visual representations of sorting algorithms (Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort).
    * Visualizations of searching algorithms (Linear Search, Binary Search).
* **Interactive Controls:**
    * Generate random arrays of adjustable sizes.
    * Control the speed of the visualization.
    * Select different algorithms from a dropdown menu.
* **Complexity Analysis:**
    * Displays the time and space complexity of each algorithm.
* **User-Friendly Interface:**
    * Clean and intuitive design for ease of use.
    * Responsive design.

## Technologies Used

* **HTML:** For the structure of the web page.
* **CSS:** For styling and layout.
* **JavaScript:** For the logic and animations of the algorithms.

## How to Use

1.  **Generate Array:** Click the "Generate Array" button to create a new array of random numbers.
2.  **Select Algorithm:** Choose an algorithm from the dropdown menu.
3.  **Adjust Settings:** Use the size and speed sliders to customize the visualization.
4.  **Visualize:** Click the "Visualize" button to see the algorithm in action.
5.  **Complexity:** See the time and space complexity of the algorithm in the information panel.
